            <h2>Why Košice?</h2>
            <h3>Košice, the second-largest city in Slovakia</h3>
            <p>
              Košice is situated on the river Hornád at the eastern reaches of
              the Slovak Ore Mountains, near the border with Hungary. Being the
              economic and cultural centre of eastern Slovakia, Košice is the
              seat of the Košice Region and Košice Self-governing Region, it
              belongs to the Košice-Prešov agglomeration, and is home to the
              Slovak Constitutional Court, three universities, various dioceses,
              and many museums, galleries, and theatres. In 2013 Košice was the
              European Capital of Culture, together with Marseille, France.
              Košice is an important industrial centre of Slovakia, and the U.S.
              Steel Košice steel mill is the largest employer in the city. The
              town has extensive railway connections and an international
              airport.
            </p>
            <p>
              The city has a preserved historical centre which is the largest
              among Slovak towns. There are heritage protected buildings in
              Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and Art Nouveau styles with
              Slovakia's largest church: the Cathedral of St. Elizabeth. The
              long main street, rimmed with aristocratic palaces, Catholic
              churches, and townsfolk's houses, is a thriving pedestrian zone
              with boutiques, cafés, and restaurants. The city is known as the
              first settlement in Europe to be granted its own coat-of-arms.

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
              Hi! My name is Anna and I've been visiting Košice for several
              years, ever since meeting my husband who was born there. I'm very
              fond of the city. I created this page as part of a project for
              SheCodes Responsive to develop my coding skills.
